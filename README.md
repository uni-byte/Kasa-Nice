# Kasa-Nice
A GUI application for python-kasa to control devices in your local network.

Uses the NICEGUI library to launch a desktop application (or browser, through localhost) from which you are able to control your TP-Link Kasa Smart devices.
Note: the app can only discover devices in your LOCAL NETWORK, it has no access to your cloud account.

Tested on Windows 10 only so far, BUT should work on other OSes as well. Lemme know ;)
